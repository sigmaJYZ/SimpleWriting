# Changelog

Each entry names the version, the date, and the measured effect where one exists.

## 2.1.1.4, 2026-10-04

- Changed: the repository has the name SimpleWriting, and the marketplace
  and the plugin have the name `simple-writing`. The install command is
  `claude plugin install simple-writing@simple-writing`. An install of an
  earlier release must move: remove the marketplace `simple-english`, then
  add the repository again.
- Added: the output style `simple-writing:simple-writing`. It holds the
  upstream rule block and then the layer.
- Changed: the README of the fork is `README.md` in the root folder, with
  `README.zh-CN.md` for Chinese. The README of the original has the name
  `README.upstream.md`.
- Fixed: the reply check reported the dash in a Russian reply. A Cyrillic
  reply keeps its dashes now, the same as a Cyrillic document.
- Changed: in the layer, the note on the Russian and Ukrainian dash applies
  to replies and to documents. No benchmark ran on this text. The published
  results describe the layer of 2.1.1.3.
- Changed: the message of the file check says "hit(s)".
- Added: the Codex install commands in the README, after one run in a Codex
  session.

## 2.1.1.3, 2026-10-04

- Fixed: the Chinese check was slow on a large file. A file of 1 MB with a
  hit on each line took 9 seconds, and the hook has a limit of 10 seconds.
  A line number is now one binary search, and the same file takes 0.3
  seconds.
- Fixed: a text with many code spans counted as not English in some cases,
  because the placeholders for code counted as words of the text. They do
  not count now.
- Added: `.github/README.md`, a short README for the fork. GitHub shows it
  before the upstream `README.md`, which stays in place.
- Added: tests for files that the hook cannot read, and a self-test that
  sends every English output in the repository through the language gate.

## 2.1.1.2, 2026-10-04

- Added: a language layer in `prompts/language-layer.md`. A second
  `SessionStart` hook prints it after the upstream rule block. The model
  writes in the language of the user. The layer adds no rule of its own: it
  gives the Chinese form of each upstream rule that names English words or
  English grammar. The upstream rule files did not change.
- Added: `evals/lang_lint.py`, a language gate. Chinese text gets the four
  upstream checks that have a Chinese form: sentence length, semicolon,
  dash, and filler words. The Chinese sentence limit counts units: 35 for
  procedural text and 40 for descriptive text. Text in other languages gets
  no hits from the English word lists. English text gives the same result
  as before.
- Changed: the `PostToolUse` hook and the `Stop` hook start from
  `src/hooks/lint_hook_fork.py`. For a file that is not English, an `Edit`
  is judged on the lines that the edit touched.
- Added: `evals/run_layer_bench.py` with two suites and their results under
  `evals/results/`. On claude-sonnet-5-5, 1 of 8 Chinese document tasks came
  back in English with the upstream rules, and none with the layer. On the
  upstream English questions and tasks, the layer made no clear change.
- Changed: the version scheme. The version is the upstream version plus one
  part for the fork revision. Revision 1 had the name 2.1.2. `FORK.md` gives
  the details.

## 2.1.2, 2026-10-04

- Fixed: the linter now ends a sentence at `。`, `！`, and `？`. These marks
  need no white space after them. Before this fix, `sentences()` joined a full
  Chinese paragraph into one sentence, and the `PostToolUse` check reported a
  false `sentence_over_limit` hit. One Chinese report of 303 lines went from
  10 false hits to 0. English text gives the same result as before.

## 2.1.1, 2026-09-30

- Changed: removed wording in the skill that broke the skill's own rules. The
  12 document rules in SKILL.md lost their bold lead-ins. Rule 11 lost its
  "not X, but Y" title. The References list, the rule-catalog headings, and
  four cells in word-swaps.md lost their em-dashes. The rule content did not
  change.
- Removed: filler and claims with no source. SKILL.md lost "a tired
  mechanic", "Nothing else in this file is optional", and "Read them last,
  apply them first". use-cases.md lost "a stressed reader at 2 a.m." and "STE
  cuts the error rate and the cost". rule-catalog.md lost "The ones agents
  break are 1.7, 1.11, and 1.13". The SKILL.md example is now labeled "AI
  output" and not "real AI output", because no committed eval file holds it.
- Changed: the sentence "The same rule covers a fact, not just a word" in
  SKILL.md, `prompts/system-prompt.md`, and `output-styles/simple-english.md`
  now starts "Also name the host". The two mirrors stay byte-identical.
- No benchmark ran on this release. The published figures still describe
  2.0.1.

## 2.1.0, 2026-09-16

- Removed: the five-sentence cap on the reply. The rule is gone from SKILL.md,
  the output style, the system prompt, the self-check, the Stop hook, and the
  linter. Users reported that replies on multi-part questions came out as one
  paragraph. A rescore of the committed 2026-09-02 replies shows the cap was
  met in only 5 of 16 replies, and that the same replies had 18.9% of sentences
  over 25 words against 5.7% for release 2.0.0, which had no formatting rule.
  The cap did not hold and it did not shorten sentences. (#35)
- Changed: `reader_check()` no longer counts over-cap sentences in
  `visible_total`, because the skill no longer asks for five sentences. The
  published reply figure moves from 86% fewer visible defects (406 to 58) to
  95% fewer (218 to 11), recomputed from the same raw files by
  `python3 evals/check_numbers.py`. The counted classes are now em-dashes,
  bold, headers, and bullets. `sentences` is still reported, as a count and
  not a limit.

## 2.0.2, 2026-09-08

- Fixed: the PostToolUse hook message said "Run the self-check in SKILL.md
  before you deliver." At least one harness read that as an instruction to
  search the install folder for a file. It read this instead of running the
  check inside the skill already loaded. The message now names the change
  directly. (#31)

## 2.0.1, 2026-09-04 to 2026-09-06

- Rebuilt the skill around two registers, the document and the reply, after
  an audit found the old benchmark measured obedience to the linter, not what
  a reader sees. SKILL.md is 1,825 tokens. The 53-rule catalog moved to
  `references/rule-catalog.md`. Visible reply defects (over-cap sentences,
  em-dashes, bold, headers, bullets) fell from 406 to 58 pooled over 16
  replies on claude-sonnet-4-6. A blind judge preferred 2.0.1 over 2.0.0 in
  14 of 16 pairs. Full method: `evals/results/rebuild-2026-09-02/RESULTS.md`.
- Added `evals/check_numbers.py`, which recomputes every published number
  from the raw files and fails the build on a mismatch. Wired into CI.
- Fixed the Codex hook file collision: Claude Code auto-discovers
  `hooks/hooks.json` at the plugin root, so the Codex configuration moved to
  `.codex-plugin/hooks.json`.
- Fixed: table rows in Markdown were blanked whole by the linter, which
  exempted every cell inside them from every check. Each cell is now its own
  sentence unit.
- Fixed: the PostToolUse hook linted Claude's own memory and configuration
  files. It now skips the Claude configuration directory and any path a
  `SIMPLE_ENGLISH_LINT_EXCLUDE` glob names.
- Fixed: the `claude-opus-4-8` benchmark row (1.05 baseline) did not
  reproduce. Re-run with a clean baseline: 3.64. Old files moved to
  `evals/results/raw-superseded/`.
- Removed `references/checklist.md`. Nothing loaded it, and its content
  restated the self-check, the catalog, and the linter.
- Took the ASD-STE100 word-list extractor and the word-choice linter from a
  closed pull request, without the extracted word lists themselves: the
  standard forbids reproducing them without written authority from ASD. Users
  build the lists locally from their own copy of the free PDF, in
  `tools/ste-dictionary/`.
- Added claude-fable-5-1 and claude-fable-5 rows to the linter benchmark, and
  seven opencode model rows.

## 2.0.0, 2026-09-01

- Pivoted the default mode from strict ASD-STE100 enforcement to Plain: the
  same structural rules, plus rules for readers outside the field and a
  reply register, with Strict kept as a document-only overlay.
